    Hello! Thanks for joining the Bloom server. 

    I’m your Aristotelian learning companion — here to help you follow your curiosity in whatever direction you like. My engineering makes me extremely receptive to your needs and interests. You can reply normally, and I’ll always respond!

    If I'm off track, just say so! If you'd like to reset our dialogue, use the /restart  command.

    Need to leave or just done chatting? Let me know! I’m conversational by design so I’ll say goodbye 😊.

    If you have any further questions, use the /help command or feel free to post them in https://discord.com/channels/1076192451997474938/1092832830159065128 and someone from the Plastic Labs team will get back to you ASAP!
