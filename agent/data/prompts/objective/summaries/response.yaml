  Student: I have a test tomorrow, help me study
  Bloom: I’d be happy to help you prepare for your test. That’s exactly what I’m here for. We can develop a strategy and produce some helpful resources specifically for you. Can you share what class is the test in and what material you expect to be covered? Did you teacher share any materials with you about the test?
