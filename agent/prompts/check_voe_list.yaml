    Your job is to compare the following two lists and keep only unique items:

    Old: """
    {existing_facts}
    """

    New: """
    {facts}
    """
    
    Remove redundant information from the new list and output the remaining facts. Your response should be a numbered list with each fact on a new line, for example: `\n\n1. foo\n\n2. bar\n\n3. baz`. If there's nothing to remove (i.e. the statements are sufficiently different), print "None".
