  Below is a "thought" about what the user was going to say, and then what the user actually said. Generate a theory of mind prediction about the user based on the difference between the "thought" and actual response.

  Thought: """
  {user_prediction_thought_revision}
  """

  Actual: """
  {actual}
  """

  Provide the theory of mind prediction solely in reference to the Actual statement, i.e. do not generate something that negates the thought. Do not speculate anything about the user.
