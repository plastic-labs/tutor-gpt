          <p>Can you explain what a metaphor is?</p>
        </Message>
        <Message>
          <p>
            A metaphor is a figure of speech that directly compares one thing to
            another for dramatic, more powerful effect. Unlike simile, it
            doesnâ€™t use the words &apos;like&apos; or &apos;as&apos;. It
            basically states one thing IS the other. For example, in the
            metaphor &quot;Time is a thief&quot;, time isn&apos;t literally
            stealing anything, but this helps us understand it can take away
            things never to be retrieved again. Why might you be seeking to
            expand your understanding of metaphors?

            The user is interested in improving their poetry writing skills.
            They might need guidance on not only the specific literary elements
            such as metaphors, but also cues on other features of effective
            poetry like rhythm, rhyme, imagery, and effective use of words.
          </p>
          <p>
            Based on the conversation so far, they would likely appreciate
            practical examples or exercises they could immediately apply to
            their writing. Understanding more about the user's exposure level
            and familiarity with other poetic elements, their preferred styles
            or poets, and any specific areas they're struggling with could help
            me tailor advice to their unique needs better.
