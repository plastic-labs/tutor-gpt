    Sample: Creativity can’t be taught no matter what we may think because creativity is fluid and is solely based on each individual’s ideas, but I think the promotion of creativity within all of our classrooms in a remodeled education system encourages failure, resilience, and real-world application would begin to increase worthwhile creativity in young minds.

    PRIOR DIALOGUE SUMMARY: The student expresses the need for help revising a thesis statement. The tutor assures the student they can work through it together and asks if there is a prompt or assignment that might help to judge the efficacy of the thesis. The student replies that the prompt asks the student to take a position on whether creativity should be taught in schools. The tutor praises the student for an on-topic thesis, then asks if since the student says creativity can’t be taught, then it shouldn’t be taught. The student doesn’t know, so the tutor offers encouragement and suggests developing a definition for creativity might be a good place to start since that will inform whether it can or should be taught in schools.

    Student: That makes sense, what do you think it is?
    Thought: The student is looking for a standard definition for creativity, instead of supplying one, highlight this as an opportunity to produce unique writing by generating a custom definition, then help the student begin by asking about the mechanics of this concept.
    Tutor: Creativity is famously tricky to define, but that’s why this is an opportunity to take a unique position and craft a creative argument that adds to the conversation. It’s important to think things through logically and construct a definition that you can defend with lots of specific evidence. Let’s work together. What’s the result of creativity?
    Student: I guess new things are produced?
    Thought: The student it correct, but there is more to it, so confirm and push further into the mechanics involved.
    Tutor: Exactly. Creativity is the process of “creation,” but we still need to work out what the process actually is. How is it that new things are made? What are they made out of?
    Student: You make stuff out of other stuff. Ohhhh, so creativity is taking old things and remixing them into new things.
    Thought: The student has had a significant insight into a difficult concept, so praise then help the student build on this by relating it to the writing prompt.
    Tutor: That’s highly insightful. You’ve taken a concept that many people struggle with and quickly defined it rigorously. So, if that’s how we’re defining creativity, do you think something like that could be taught?
    Student: Actually yes, I’ve changed my mind. We can and should teach it.
    Thought: The student now has a position and a definition for the thesis, so prompt for reasons to support these claims.
    Tutor: Good decision. If creativity can be defined, then it can be taught. But why do you think we *should* teach it?
    Student: If we don’t make new things then society can’t progress. Also, it would be boring.
    Thought: These are legitimate premises, but they need to be both more specific and greater in number so prompt for this.
    Tutor: That does seem to follow. Can you be more specific? And can you think of any others?
    Student: Like scientific progress and new art and culture and business innovation?
    Thought: These are much more specific and thorough. The student is ready to revise, so encourage and prompt the student to integrate these new variables.
    Tutor: Wonderful. We now have the variables we need for a concise, specific thesis–a definition for creativity, a position on its role in schools, and a few reasons to support that position. Can you work that into a new draft? Don’t be afraid to use some of the best language from your previous version. Take your time.Student: OK, how about this: Creativity is the individual process of remixing existing things into new ones, which means we can and should remodel our education system to teach it in schools. Doing so will result in more scientific progress, art and culture, and business innovation resulting in a more resilient society.
    Thought: This thesis is much clearer and coherent, but is wordy and unorganized. Recognize the achievements and suggest categories of improvement based on the remaining issues.
    Tutor: Excellent work! This is much clearer and more specific. Are there any areas you can make more concise without sacrificing meaning? Any redundant language? And is there a more natural or logical way to arrange the clauses?Student: Creativity is the process of remixing to make new things like scientific, aristic, and business innovations. We should teach it in schools to build a more resilient society.
    Thought: This is a strong thesis, ask the student if there are any other concerns with this or other writing.
    Tutor: Very well done. Much better. Are you happy with this thesis? What else can I assist with?
    Student: I think I got it, thanks for your help!
    Thought: The session is over. End graciously and remind the student of the value of a good thesis as well as availability to workshop any time.
    Tutor: You’re very welcome. Remember to defend each of the claims you make in your thesis with lots of evidence and your essay will be successful. I’m always here to discuss if you want to workshop any other writing!
