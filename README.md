Tutor-GPT is a LangChain LLM application developed by [Plastic Labs](https://plasticlabs.ai). It dynamically reasons about your learning needs and *updates its own prompts* to best serve you.  

We leaned into theory of mind experiments and it is now more than just a literacy tutor, itâ€™s an expansive learning companion. Read more about how it works [here](https://plasticlabs.ai/blog/Theory-of-Mind-is-All-You-Need). 

The hosted version of `tutor-gpt` is called [Bloom](https://bloombot.ai) as a nod to Benjamin Bloom's Two Sigma Problem. You can try the web version at [chat.bloombot.ai](https://chat.bloombot.ai) or you can join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/bloombotai) to try out our implementation for free (while our OpenAI spend lasts ðŸ˜„).  

Alternatively, you can run your own instance of the bot by following the instructions below.  

## Project Structure

The tutor-gpt project is split between multiple different modules that split up the backend logic for different clients. 

- `agent/` - this contains the core logic and prompting architecture 
- `bot/` - this contains the discord bot implementation
- `api/` - this contains an API interface to the tutor-gpt backend
- `www/` - this contains a `NextJS` web front end that can connect to the API interface 
- `common/` - this contains common used in different interfaces

Most of the project is developed using python with the exception of the NextJS application. For python `poetry` is used for dependency management and for the web interface `yarn` is used.

### Supabase

Additionally, this project uses supabase for managing different users, authentication, and as the database for holding message and conversation information.

## Installation

> NOTE: The project uses [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installing-with-the-official-installer) and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install) for package management. 

The below commands will install all the dependencies necessary for running the tutor-gpt project. We recommend using poetry to setup a virtual environment for the project. 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/plastic-labs/tutor-gpt.git
cd tutor-gpt
poetry install # install Python dependencies
cd www/
yarn install # install all NodeJS dependencies 
```

### Docker

Alternatively (The recommended way) this project can be built and run with docker. [Install docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and ensure it's running before proceeding. 

The web front end is built and run separately from the remainder of the codebase. Below are the commands for building the core of the tutor-gpt project which includes the necessary dependencies for running either the discord bot or the FastAPI endpoint.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/plastic-labs/tutor-gpt.git
cd tutor-gpt
docker build -t tutor-gpt-core .
```

Similarly, to build the web interface run the below commands
```bash
cd tutor-gpt/www
docker build -t tutor-gpt-web .
```

> NOTE: for poetry usage

This project uses [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) to manage dependencies.
To install dependencies locally run `poetry install`. Or alternatively run
`poetry shell` to activate the virtual environment

To activate the virtual environment within the same shell you can use the
following one-liner:

```bash
source $(poetry env info --path)/bin/activate
```

On some systems this may not detect the proper virtual environment. You can
diagnose this by running `poetry env info` directly to see if the virtualenv
is defined.

If using `pyenv` remember to set **prefer-active-python** to true. As per
this section of the [documentation](https://python-poetry.org/docs/managing-environments/).

Another workaround that may work if the above setting does not work is to
continue directly with `poetry shell` or wrap the source command like below

```bash
poetry run source $(poetry env info --path)/bin/activate
```

## Usage

This app requires you to have a few different environment variables set. Create a `.env` file from the `.env.template`. Depending on which interface you are running (web or discord) different variables are necessary. This is explained below

### Required
**OPENAI_API_KEY**: Go to [OpenAI](https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys) to generate your own API key.  
**SUPABASE_URL**: The base URL for your supabase instance  
**SUPABASE_KEY**: The API key for interacting with your supabase project. get it from your project settings   
**CONVERSATION_TABLE**: the name of the table to hold conversation metadata  
**MEMORY_TABLE**: the name of the table holding messages for different conversations

### Discord Only
**BOT_TOKEN**: This is the discord bot token. You can find instructions on how to create a bot and generate a token in the [pycord docs](https://guide.pycord.dev/getting-started/creating-your-first-bot).  
**THOUGHT_CHANNEL_ID**: This is the discord channel for the bot to output thoughts to. Make a channel in your server and copy the ID by right clicking the channel and copying the link. The channel ID is the last string of numbers in the link.  

### Web Only
**URL**: the URL that the web ui is running from by default this should be http://localhost:3000


### Docker/Containerization

The repository containers a `Dockerfile` for running the bot in a containerized workflow. Use the following command to build and run the container locally:

```bash
docker build -t tutor-gpt:latest .
docker run --env-file .env tutor-gpt 
```

The current behaviour will utilize the `.env` file in your local repository and
run the bot. There are two separate entry points for tutor-gpt both a discord UI
and a web ui. Below contains snippets for manually specifying the execution
environment.

```bash
docker run --env-file .env tutor-gpt python -u -m bot.app # Discord UI
docker run -p 8501:8501 --env-file .env tutor-gpt python -u -m streamlit run www/main.py # Web UI
```
